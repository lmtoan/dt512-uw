<Vietnamese foreigner, never had an interaction with police, not threatened ethnic group or income class>

<Democratic-leaning, upset with the influx of news about police shootings, more likely to find evidences to criticize police shootings>

<Sensitive results, heavily biased, should take into considerations, only applied to New York City. Statistics might be widely different from other less tech-savvy states>
