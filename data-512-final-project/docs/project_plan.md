### Data Description

I will be using a combination of historic and year-to-date data that capture every shooting incident occured in New York City from 2013 to 2018. Their links are referenced below:
- [NYPD Shooting Incident Data *(Historic)*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8). Created on June 5, 2018. Last updated on November 8, 2018.
- [NYPD Shooting Incident Data *(Year To Date)*](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Year-To-Date-/5ucz-vwe8). Created on June 5, 2018. Last updated on November 8, 2018.

Reviewed by Office of Management Analysis and Planning and provided by New York Police Department, the data provide a comprehensive view about "the shooting event, the location and time of occurrence, and information related to suspect and victim demographics".

Several limitations and potential biases are discussed in the following [section](### Limitations & Biases)

### License & Terms of Use

The datasets are hosted on [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/), collected, and maintained by the New York City government.

### Limitations & Biases

As stated in the dataset headers, the NYPD shooting incident data "is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website". Such scrutiny might result in excessive filtering of shooting incidents or metadata related to such incidents. Since the dataset

There is no description of data de-identification

The authoring agencies state that the "data can be used by the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity".

Human-Centered Design Considerations
---
<Vietnamese foreigner, never had an interaction with police, not threatened ethnic group or income class>

<Democratic-leaning, upset with the influx of news about police shootings, more likely to find evidences to criticize police shootings>

<Sensitive results, heavily biased, should take into considerations, only applied to New York City. Statistics might be widely different from other less tech-savvy states>
